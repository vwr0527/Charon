Hi FrischerHering!

As you know, I want to make a spaceship game. This game needs a bunch of sounds. I haven't given much thought to the sound design, but I have always heard it in my head sounding a lot like the sound effects from "Descent" and "Super Metroid".

Here's a partial list of FX wanted:

Explosions:
Big explosion
Medium explosion
small explosion

Weapons:
Chaingun reloading
Chaingun spinning
Gunfire
Shell casing clinking
Plasma gun fire
Laser gun fire
Missile launching

Enemies:
Alarm sounds
Angry insect sounds
Robot chatter

Ship:
Shield hit
Shield lost
Shield regenerated
Metallic hit
Powerup acquired
Thrust noise
Afterburner thrust noise
Afterburner powering down

Environment:
Door opening
Door needs key - denied chirp
Door needs key - key used chirp
Wet organic bursting sounds
Electric humming
Electric arcing and sparking


As for the music, I'm thinking something like "Super Metroid". Though don't take that too literally. Take liberties.

This is a large request I know. But you can publish this on your website and let anyone else use them. I will appreciate any amount that you make! If you make some, I may not end up using every sound you create, but considering I'm not that picky about sound, and I have no intention of creating them myself, I probably will use them!

Obviously I will credit you, and link to your website in the "credits" section of the game. Thanks!
